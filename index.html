    <p>
      Welcome to the new iLab New Feature Request form! Weâ€™ve moved the process
      of submitting new feature requests to JIRA to help streamline access for
      all team members and improve communications about request submissions.
      Please use this form to submit suggestions for new features or
      enhancements to our current system. The Product Marketing (PdM) team will
      review these requests on a regular basis and will communicate the outcome
      of the PdM review with the iLab request submitter, either directly or
      through the use of Comments in the JIRA story.</p>

    <p>If approved, requests may be:
    <ol><li>Added to a team's product line backlog if the request or enhancement
        appears to be on the smaller side (fewer than 8 points of work)</li>
        <li>If the request or enhancement appears to fall into the category of a
          larger project, a Business Brief may be presented to senior leadership
          for further review and approval.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        iLab team members are encouraged to use JIRA's Voting capabilities to indicate their support for a feature request or enhancement! We suggest that you bookmark this JIRA board [insert JIRA board URL, to be created by Janie], log in occasionally to check for new submissions and use the "Vote for this issue" option in the upper right-hand section of the JIRA story. Your votes will assist PdM and senior staff in prioritizing requests and enhancements.  
    </p>
